### Web 3.0 Discord 
This GitHub repository provides a step-by-step guide to build a Web 3.0 Discord clone using Solidity, Ethers.js, React, and Hardhat. Web 3.0 refers to the next generation of the internet that leverages blockchain technology and decentralized protocols to create more open, transparent, and user-centric applications.

This repository includes detailed documentation, code samples, and examples to help developers learn how to build a decentralized chat application using these cutting-edge technologies. The repository covers various topics such as setting up a development environment, writing Solidity smart contracts, interacting with Ethereum blockchain using Ethers.js, building the front-end with React, and testing the application with Hardhat.

The repository also includes best practices, design patterns, and security considerations for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Web 3.0 stack. The step-by-step guide aims to provide developers with a comprehensive understanding of how to create a Discord clone on the Web 3.0 stack, including the deployment and testing of the dApp.

# Initial Code to Run and Build:
To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local development environment.
 ``` git clone https://github.com/saqib772/web-3.0-Discord-.git ```
 
2. Install the dependencies for the Solidity smart contracts.
``` cd web3-discord-clone
cd contracts
npm install
```

3. Compile and deploy the Solidity smart contracts using Hardhat.

``` npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```
4.Install the dependencies for the React front-end.
 ``` cd ../frontend
npm install
```
5. Start the React development server.
``` npm start
```
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 and start building your Web 3.0 Discord clone!
